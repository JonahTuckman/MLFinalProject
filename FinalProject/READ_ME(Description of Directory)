For all sections I recreated the notebooks. I felt maximum learning would take place if I did not copy and paste but rather wrote out the code myself.

I have three notebook files in this directory. 

First I have a notebook that I used when working through the Pytorch tutorial and getting myself comfortable with the technology. 

I then have a notebook for Part two in which I replicate the results given by building a neural network that distinguishes ants and bees. 

I have also added a notebook for the chatbot tutorial.
This was not assigned but I thought it looked very cool and I wanted to work on it. 
I kept it in this repository because it is technically related material but I will migrate it to a personal repository after the class concludes.
